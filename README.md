Building
--------
LoS has a couple of dependencies
-   OpenGL
-   GLU
-   GLEW
-   TinyXML
-   ZLib
-   Box2D 2.3.x
-   [Trutle](https://github.com/pimms/trutle)
-   [Tmx-Parser](https://github.com/pimms/tmx-parser)

No effort has been made to build Trutle or LoS under Windows or OS X yet. The code 
is 99.9% platform independent, so only small modifications would be required.
